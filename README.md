# WESPLIT
This is a splitting app game where you can split the bill evenly between a group of people.

Inspired from the 100 days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson. 

This app takes in the total of the bill, calculates the sales tax and tip percentage and returns the costs per person.

<h1> Things I've learnt:</h1>
<ul>
  <li> How to create a repository using Xcode and GitHub. </li>
  <li>I had to greate a personalized token to authenticate my account with support from this <a href = "https://appmakers.substack.com/p/how-to-upload-your-xcode-project-to-github?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web">link</a>. The only thing I would change is to create a personal token classic compared to the fine grain and make sure to select the options Xcode suggests such as link user, admin and etc.</li>
  <li>Creating forms on Xcode and reading text from the user</li>
  <li>Calculating the total per person, taxes and tips</li>
</ul>
